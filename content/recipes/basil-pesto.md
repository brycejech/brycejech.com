- Pulse basil and pine nuts in a food processor.
- Add the garlic and cheese, pulse several more times.
- While the food processor is running, stream in the olive oil.
  - Adding the olive oil slowly, while the processor is running, will help it emulsify and help keep the olive oil from separating.
  - Occasionally stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor.
- Stir in salt and freshly ground black pepper, add more to taste.

Pesto darkens when exposed to air. So, to store, cover tightly with plastic wrap making sure the plastic is touching the top of the pesto, not allowing it to be exposed to air. This will help keep the pesto greener longer.
