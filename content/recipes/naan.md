- Put the yeast, sugar and two tablespoons of warm water in a bowl and stir well. Leave until it begins to froth.
- Put the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine.
- Stir the yogurt into the yeast mixture.
- Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the yogurt, plus the melted ghee.
- Mix, then gradually stir in the water to make a soft, sticky mixture that is just firm enough to call a dough, but not at all dry.
- Tip out on a lightly floured surface and knead for about five minutes until smooth and a little less sticky.
- Put dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat.
- Cover and leave in a draught-free place (the airing cupboard, or an unlit oven) until doubled in size: roughly 90â€“120 minutes.
- Tip the dough back out on to the lightly floured surface and knock the air out.
- Divide into eight balls (or six if you have a particularly large frying pan).
- Heat a non-stick frying pan over a very high heat for several minutes and put the oven on low.
- Prepare the melted ghee and any seeds to garnish.
- Flatten one of the balls and prod or roll it into a flat circle, slightly thicker around the edge.
- Pick it up by the top to stretch it slightly into a teardrop shape, then put it in the hot pan.
- When it starts to bubble, turn it over and cook until the other side is browned in patches.
- Turn it back over and cook until there are no doughy bits remaining.
- Brush with melted ghee and sprinkle with seeds, if using, and put in the oven to keep warm while you make the other breads.
